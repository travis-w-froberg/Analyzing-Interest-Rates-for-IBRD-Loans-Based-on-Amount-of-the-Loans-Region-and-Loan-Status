# Analyzing-Interest-Rates-for-IBRD-Loans-Based-on-Amount-of-the-Loans-Region-and-Loan-Status

## Section 1 Introduction

One function of the World Bank is to provide loans to developing countries. This is
ostensibly done to provide these countries with money to improve their economy. The
following analysis uses the interest rate of loans from the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) as the response variable. The World Bank
website says the following about the IBRD:

“The world’s largest development bank, IBRD provides financial products and policy
advice to help countries reduce poverty and extend the benefits of sustainable growth to
all of their people.”

The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from the World Bank website’s data
repository. Detailed information on how the data was obtained is unavailable. The
exploratory variables used in the final model are: the amount of the loan that was
disbursed at the time of data collection, the original principal amount of the loan, region
of the country who received the loan, and loan status (either cancelled, fully repaid, or
active).

The World Bank has been criticized for not living up to its self-proclaimed purpose.
There have been accusations that the World Bank lends high-interest loans to
vulnerable countries for a variety of reasons. The following analysis examined a sample
of loans given out by the World Bank to developing countries (a country must be
developing in order to receive funds from the IBRD) to examine whether the World Bank
is engaging in predatory lending practices.

In addition, the region of the loan-receiving country was used as an exploratory variable
to examine whether the World Bank is engaging in racist lending practices. For
example, if it is shown that countries in the region of east and west Africa receive loans
with significantly higher interest rates than countries in Europe or the Middle East, then
racism can be a hypothesized reason for the difference.
